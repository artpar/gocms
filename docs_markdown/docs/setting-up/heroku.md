# Heroku deployment

Heroku is the best way to test out a live instance of daptin. Daptin has a very low memory footprint and can run smoothly even on heroku's smallest instance.

Note: Heroku puts instances to sleep after 30 minutes of idleness, which will erase all the data. It will behave like a fresh instance when it wakes up. You can subscribe to their minimum paid plan to remove this sleep due to idleness.
