# User Management

Daptin natively manages users and usergroups so that it has no dependency on external user management services. Though it can be integrated with such services.

## User groups

User groups is a group concept that helps you manage "who" can interact with daptin, and in what ways.

Users and Objects belong to one or more user group.
