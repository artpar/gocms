Daptin is an **open-source backend** to develop and deploy **production-ready APIs** based applications. With Daptin you can design your data model and have a production ready JSON API online in minutes.

By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application.


Easily consume the following features on any device

- Relational database backed persistent data
- CRUD **JSON API**
- User registration and login system
- Social login with oauth2: tested with google, github, linkedin
- Extensive state tracking APIs
- Enable *Data Auditing* from a single switch
- [Market place](https://github.com/daptin/market) enabling a variety of features
- **Cloud storage sync** like gdrive, dropbox, b2, s3 and more
- Manage multiple websites under separate sub-domain/sub-paths
- Connect with external APIs by using internal extension points

- **Database** to easily evolves your data schema & migrates your database [Postgres/MySQL/SQLite]
- **Flexible auth** using the JWT-based authentication & permission system
- **Works with all frontend frameworks** like React, Vue.js, Angular, Android, iOS
- **Very low memory requirement** and horizontally scalable
- **Can be deployed on a wide range of hardware** arm5,arm6,arm7,arm64,mips,mips64,mips64le,mipsle (or build for your target using go)

# Where to begin

The first thing you want to do after deploying a new instance is register yourself as a user on the dashboard. This part can be automated for redistributable applications.

## Become admin

Only the first user can become an **administrator** and only until no one else signs up. If the first user doesn't invoke "Become admin" before another user signs up, then it becomes a public instance which is something you would rarely want.

When you "Become admin", daptin will restart itself and schedule an update for itself where it makes you [the owner](/auth/authorization.md) of everything and update permission of all exposed apis. At this point guest users will not be allowed to invoke sign up process.

## Usage Road map

Quick road map to various things you can do from here:

* [Enable sign up for guests](/actions/signin.md)
* [Expose APIs](/setting-up/entities.md)
* [Set access permission](/auth/permissions.md)
* [Get a client library](http://jsonapi.org/implementations) for your frontend
* [Enable Auditing](/data-modeling/auditing.md) to maintain change logs
* [Connect to a cloud storage](/data-modeling/data_storage.md)
* Host a [static-site](/subsite/subsite.md)
